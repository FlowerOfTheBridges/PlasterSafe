# PlasterTalk Design
The main goal of *PlasterTalk* is to make smart a museum with the help of all the people who guarantee its life, from visitors to staff.
This is possible by giving to the following categories of users the following tools:
- *Statues*: the moving force of the museum will be provided with a board that will measure the ambient temperature and their movements in order to be viewed by all staff members.
- *Visitors*: can download a mobile application to see what are the statues within the room they're in and see additional informations about it. They can also give a feedback on the statues.
- *Curators*: employers who need to manage all the aspect for a specific exhibit, gallery, or section will be provided with a Web Application that will give them the opportunity to:
  - assign a statue to a given room
  - provide informations to a statue in order to be seen by the visitors on their application
  - see the feedback given by the users
  - see the current status of a status and change it if needed
- *Archivists*: employers responsible for maintaining the collection of artifacts to the museum will be provided with a Web Application that will give them the opportunity to: 
  - see the current measures given by the statues (like the ambient temperature or movements)  
  - change status of the statue in order to give them the opportunity to be managed for possible maintenance work
- *Security Staff*: in order to have a general overview if all statues of the museum are fine and well, a mobile application will be used by them to see if any strange behaviour is detected by any statue 

## User Personas
To have a better understanding of the environment in which *PlasterTalk* will work, we created four persona that will be affected by our solution. This process has be done in order to have a better understanding of what should be the possible situation where the application will work. The data cards below are essential in order to give a proper characterization of the users.

## Storyboards
For each persona we develop a storyboard, i.e. a concrete situation where our application can solve one or many needs by the interested person.

### Curator Storyboard
Ginevra manage all the aspect for a specific exhibit, gallery, or section, for example: 
- where the statues are located
- what are the most important works 

According to the feedback of each person, Ginevra must check on its list information relating to the museum's works of art, such as its history and the material with which it was made. Furthermore, one of his tasks is to write and replace the infographics of the various statues inside the museum, and to group the statues according to their characteristics. For this, he created a questionnaire that visitors can fill in at the end of the visit.
### Archivist Storyboard
Annette sits at her desk and catalogs new artifacts that arrives. She must keeps track if a statue is moved to a different room and, in such case, which room is.  She also handles the information about the statues and checks whether mistakes are present or not.
### Student Storyboard
Antonio was forced by his girlfriend to visit a sculpture exhibition in the museum. While his girlfriend, a student of the Academy of Fine Arts, carefully observes each work to grasp every single detail, Antonio wanders through the rooms of the museum to read the information of the various works. He has to wait for people in front of the statue to leave so that they can read the descriptions. 
Moreover, the order in which he sees the various works is completely random.
### Security Storyboard
Jamie is the museum's security officer. In particular, it manages the influx of visitors to preserve the stability of the statues. Given the size of the museum and the presence of many visitors, it is difficult to check the different areas of the museum at the same time. If a statue is moved, he cannot know where the statue is currently located.
