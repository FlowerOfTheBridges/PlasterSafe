# PlasterSafe Design
The main goal of *PlasterSafe* is to make smart the maintenance of statues during particular complex movements between various exhibitions.
This is possible by giving to the following categories of users the following tools:
- *Statues*: the moving force of the museum will be provided with a board that will measure the ambient temperature and their movements in order to be viewed by all staff members.
- *Archivists*: employers responsible for maintaining the collection of artifacts to the museum will be provided with a Web Application that will give them the opportunity to: 
  - see the measures given by the statues such as:
    - *temperature*: this measure is important to be taken into account whenever the statue is moving or not. In fact, for some materials like plaster, thermal shock could be a critical issue,
    - *vibrations*: this measure needs to be take into account during the movement of a statue, since sudden movements may damage some parts of the statue. 
  - assign a statue to a particular courier, to give him the opportunity to access the values measured by the statue,
  - compile the *condition report*, a document written after every movement to address the status of an artwork. To do so, the archivist need to know if the movement itself was made in safe conditions.  
  
- *Courier*: employers who has the duty to carry a statue from one destination to another. He should have a real-time response from the statue itsfel: for this purpose, a mobile application will be used to see if any strange behaviour is detected by any statue 

## User Personas
To have a better understanding of the environment in which *PlasterSafe* will work, we created two personas that will be affected by our solution. This process has be done in order to have a better understanding of what should be the possible situation where the application will work. The data cards below are essential in order to give a proper characterization of the users.

## Storyboards
For each persona we develop a storyboard, i.e. a concrete situation where our application can solve one or many needs by the interested person.

### Archivist Storyboard
Annette sits at her desk and catalogs new artifacts that come and leave the museum. She must keeps track if a statue is moved to a different museum for a temporary exhibit and, in such case, how to arrange the transportation with the affiliated *couriers* of the museum. After each movement, she needs to compile a *condition report* of the statue to be sure that after each movement the statue does not present any damage at all. 
### Security Storyboard
Jamie is one the museum's courier. It was assigned to manage a statue movement from Rome to Venice, where a plaster needs to be shown at a temporary exhibition about the ancient Etruscan Age. He needs to be in the same truck where the statue will be placed, and be sure that during the journey across Italy  manages the influx of visitors to preserve the stability of the statues. Given the size of the museum and the presence of many visitors, it is difficult to check the different areas of the museum at the same time. If a statue is moved, he cannot know where the statue is currently located.
