# PlasterSafe Evaluation
The evaluations will be made from the user's point of view and from a technical point of view.

## User:
Following the conference with the director of the "Museo dell'Arte Classica - Sapienza" we collected the information necessary to develop a security system for moving statues outside the museum. So our project is to monitor the statues during transport from one museum to another, from one exhibition to another. Two types of museum workers will use our application, the archivist and the courier. 
* The archivist will be able to manage the transport of the statues safely having the possibility to monitor the statues both during transport and during the exhibition;

* The courier will be able to transport the statues safely by having real-time notifications of any situations harmful to the statues.

At the end of each transport it is possible to download a report, in * csv * format, with all the details of the transport.

## Software:
The heart of our application is in the Riot-OS system firmware. This firmware can be loaded onto any board capable of running the Riot-OS system. In our project we used a Board STM32 Nucleo to which a gyroscope was connected, for calculating the movements on each axis, and a temperature and humidity sensor, able to monitor the environment in which it resides.

The firmware developed has the ability to read the data from the sensors and send them to the Gateway. Not having all the components available, the connection with the Gateway was made via the Serial port.

The gateway is represented by a Raspberry Pi 3, which via a Python script acts as a 'transparent bridge'. After receiving the data from the boards attached to the statues, which may be more than one, the Gateway processes them and after analyzing the data it is able to assess whether the statue is in a dangerous situation. In the event of a dangerous situation, an alert is raised on the mobile application in order to promptly notify the courier. The processed data is sent to the Cloud, in this way even the archivist is able to always check the status of the statues.

The efficiency of the system was assessed by calculating the latency times on the alerts, the times may vary slightly based on the number of boards attached to the statue but the results are satisfactory, in case of danger our system is able to raise an alert in about a second.
