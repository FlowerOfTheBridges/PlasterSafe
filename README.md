## Description

As part the [Internet of Things course of MSc in Computer Science Engineering at La Sapienza](http://ichatz.me/Site/InternetOfThings2020), *Plaster Talk* is a project, designed for [Museo dell'Arte Classica - Sapienza](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/museo-arte-classica), that aims to make artworks a living part of the museum, providing to the visitors useful information, thanks to the support of the museum staff.
